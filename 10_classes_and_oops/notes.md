# javascript and classes

# Object
- collection of properties and methods
-toLowerCase()

# why use OOP
because the code was all messed up (spagetti code) and oops gives a proper structure to the code

# parts of OOP
Object literal (means literally its an object)

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new, this)

# 4 pillars
Abstraction
Eg fetch (it hides details and does work, it doesn't tell how network calls work and all)
Encapsulation (means hiding everything and giving only which is required like methods and all, basically means to put a wrapper around)
Inheritance
Polymorphism (means one method does lot of things, poly means mant, morphism means models)
